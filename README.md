# Photo Manager
"A lightweight, image-focused desktop file manager."

## üìù Description
This is a local desktop application that allows users to import, browse, view, and organize photos stored on their computer. It reads image files directly from the local file system using file paths and displays them in a clean, user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing.

This project was created as a way to explore data persistence, understand how to connect the disk (file system) to a software interface, and design an intuitive, clutter-free experience for managing photos. The goal is to make photo organization extremely easy and accessible, without the noise or complexity of traditional photo apps.

It also serves as a learning platform to strengthen my skills in GUI design, file handling, and software architecture. In the future, I plan to integrate a lightweight database (such as SQLite for local storage) to store photo metadata like tags, dates, and user-defined categories.

## üöß Status:
In Development ‚Äì Core UI and photo importing/browsing is functional. Currently working on album creation functionality and favoriting system.

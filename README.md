# Photo Manager
"A lightweight, image-focused desktop file manager."

## üìù Description
This is a local desktop application that allows users to browse, view, and organize photos stored on their computer. It accesses image files directly from the local file system using file paths and displays them in a clean, user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing.

This project was created as a way to explore data persistence, understand how to connect the disk (file system) to a software interface, and design an intuitive, clutter-free experience for managing photos. The goal is to make photo organization extremely easy and accessible, without the noise or complexity of traditional photo apps.

It has also served as a valuable learning platform to practice the overall software development process, including creating detailed design documents such as user stories, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams. This preparation helps me organize requirements, model system behavior, and plan the application‚Äôs architecture before coding. In the future, I plan to integrate a lightweight database (such as SQLite for local storage) to store photo metadata like tags, dates, and user-defined categories.

## üöß Status:
In Development ‚Äì Core UI and photo importing/browsing is functional. Currently working on album creation functionality and favoriting system.
